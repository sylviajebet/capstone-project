				<p class="blog-post-meta">February 15, 2021 by <a href="#">Sylvia Jebet Kipkemoi</a>
				</p>

				<p>This blog post shows a few different types of content that's supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic typography, images, and code are all supported.

            <hr>
				<p>I participated in the first ever cohort of the 21CSkills program by AppsLab Ke and Liquid Telecom and had the following insights to share about my experience:
				</p>
				
            <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
				<p>I took on the artificial intelligence learning path, from a list of four learning paths available:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Data Science</li>
					<li>Software Development</li>
					<li>Cyber Security</li>
					<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>

				</ol>
				
            <h3>What is artificial intelligence? </h3>
				<p>Well, I initially thought of it as the science of making machines more understanding and responsive to the normal environment, hence, more ‘intelligent.’ Despite the lack of proper training in the field, I was assured that the field of A.I. was the future of technology we were to achieve.
				</p>
				<p>
					<pre><code>"Artificial intelligence is the art of making computers that behave like the ones in movies."</code></pre>
				</p>	
				<p>When presented with the 21CSkills training, the Artificial Intelligence path was my path of option. I quickly embraced the python lessons, and mathematics for machine learning lessons, with deep learning and machine learning lessons that opened my eyes more.
				</p>
				
            <h3>What was the training about? </h3>
				<p>I had a chance to explore the fields of machine learning and deep learning. There was also training in python and mathematics concepts for machine learning. The python programming training taught the basics of the language, with examples and exercises to get you well conversant with the fundamentals of the language.
				</p>
				<p>Mathematical basics of machine learning exposed me to the various calculations essential to the process of machine learning. Whereas artificial intelligence is the ability of a computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks normally performed with ‘intelligent’ beings, machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the modeling of learning processes in their multiple manifestations.
				</p>
				<p>With each new module, the processes and algorithms of artificial intelligence would be discussed further and highlighted further. The laws and ethics in data and analytics also served to ensure that the essentials of the laws and ethics of the data field are adhered to.
				</p>
				
			<h3>Would I recommend the training?</h3>
				<p>Definitely! For anyone hoping to get a good introduction to the field, this would be a perfect program. The videos are easy to understand with plenty of exercises to ensure you master the concepts. Great program by AppsLab Ke and Liquid Telecom.
